## shortest-paths-in-graphs-of-convex-sets

##This repository contains extended python code on 2d tunnel which is further converted in c++. GCC code is taken from paper [**"Shortest Paths in Graphs of Convex Sets" by Tobia Marcucci, Jack Umenberger, Pablo A. Parrilo, and Russ Tedrake**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11565).

##TODO:

##Further ablation study wrt GUROBI and Mosek Optimizer.
